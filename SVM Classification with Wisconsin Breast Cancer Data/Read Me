For this project, I used the classic Wisconsin Breast Cancer data set to build several SVM classifier models. This data set is comprised of thirty explanatory features, which are different measurements of a tumor and then the classification of whether the tumor was malignant or benign. I accessed the dataset from Kaggle.com. It is also available in the Python scikit-learn package. After loading the data, I deleted two columns - an ID column and a column that was completely blank.
