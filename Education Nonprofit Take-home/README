This was a take-home assignment as part of the interview process for a charter school network. I was given three files of testing data, which included 8 campuses, 9 grades and several thousand students. I was tasked to clean the data and draw insights. Using R I was able to join the three data tables into one data set where each student had one row with all of their information. I also feature engineered several new variables such as percentage growth and whether or not they met the standard to provide for further analysis.
